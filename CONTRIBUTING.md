### PR Title Format

- `refactor: Refactor component`
- `test: Add tests`
- `chore: Update dependencies`

## üìù Style Guidelines

### Python Style Guide

- Follow [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/)
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add docstrings to functions and classes
- Keep functions focused and small
- Maximum line length: 88 characters (Black formatter)

Example:
```python
def calculate_reading_time(content: str) -> int:
    """
    Calculate the estimated reading time for content.
    
    Args:
        content (str): The text content to analyze
        
    Returns:
        int: Estimated reading time in minutes
    """
    words = len(content.split())
    return max(1, words // 200)
```

### Django Best Practices

- Use class-based views where appropriate
- Keep views thin, models fat
- Use Django's built-in features (forms, auth, etc.)
- Follow Django naming conventions
- Use Django's ORM efficiently

### HTML/CSS Guidelines

- Use semantic HTML5 elements
- Follow TailwindCSS utility classes
- Keep custom CSS minimal
- Ensure responsive design
- Use meaningful class names

### JavaScript Guidelines

- Use ES6+ features
- Write clear, commented code
- Avoid jQuery (use vanilla JS)
- Keep functions pure when possible
- Handle errors gracefully

### Git Commit Messages

- Use present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Use imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
- Limit first line to 72 characters
- Reference issues and pull requests

Example:
```
feat: Add user notification system

- Implement real-time notifications
- Add notification preferences
- Create notification model and views

Closes #123
```

## üß™ Testing

Always add tests for new features:

```python
from django.test import TestCase
from .models import Blog

class BlogTestCase(TestCase):
    def setUp(self):
        Blog.objects.create(title="Test Blog", content="Test content")
    
    def test_blog_creation(self):
        blog = Blog.objects.get(title="Test Blog")
        self.assertEqual(blog.content, "Test content")
```

Run tests with:
```bash
python manage.py test
```
